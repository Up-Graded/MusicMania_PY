Blood is spilt while holding keys to the throne Born again, but it's too late to atone No mercy from the edge of the blade Dare escape and learn the price to be paid Let the water flow with shades of red now Arrows black out all the light (light) Death is riding into town with armor They've come to grant you your rights Hail to the king, hail to the one Kneel to the crown, stand in the sun Hail to the king Hail! Hail! Hail! The King... [Solo] There's a taste of fear (hail, hail, hail) When the henchmen call (hail, hail, hail) Iron fist to tame the land (hail, hail, hail) Iron fist to claim it all Hail to the king, hail to the one Kneel to the crown, stand in the sun Hail to the king, hail to the one Kneel to the crown, stand in the sun Hail to the king! Hail! Hail! Hail"
